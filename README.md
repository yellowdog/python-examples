# Overview

This repository contains a set of command line Python scripts for interacting with the YellowDog Platform. The scripts use the [YellowDog Python SDK](https://docs.yellowdog.co/api/python/index.html), and support:

- **Provisioning** Worker Pools
- **Submitting** Work Requirements
- **Uploading** files to the YellowDog Object Store
- **Instantiating** Compute Requirements
- **Downloading** Results from the YellowDog Object Store
- **Shutting Down** Worker Pools and **Terminating** Compute Requirements
- **Cancelling** Work Requirements
- **Aborting** running Tasks
- **Deleting** objects in the YellowDog Object Store

The operation of the commands is controlled using TOML configuration files. In addition, Work Requirements and Worker Pools can be defined using JSON files providing extensive configurability.

# YellowDog Prerequisites

To submit **Work Requirements** to YellowDog for processing by Configured Worker Pools (on-premise) and/or Provisioned Worker Pools (cloud-provisioned resources), you'll need:

1. A YellowDog Platform Account.


2. An Application Key & Secret: in the **Accounts** section under the **Applications** tab in the [YellowDog Portal](https://portal.yellowdog.co/#/account/applications), use the **Add Application** button to create a new Application, and make a note of its **Key** and **Secret** (these will only be displayed once).


To create **Provisioned Worker Pools**, you'll need:

3. A **Keyring** created via the YellowDog Portal, with access to Cloud Provider credentials as required. The Application must be granted access to the Keyring.


4. One or more **Compute Sources** defined, and a **Compute Requirement Template** created. The images used by instances must include the YellowDog agent, configured with the Task Type(s) to match the Work Requirements to be submitted.

To set up **Configured Worker Pools**, you'll need:

5. A Configured Worker Pool Token: from the **Workers** tab in the [YellowDog Portal](https://portal.yellowdog.co/#/workers), use the **+Add Configured Worker Pool** button to create a new Worker Pool and generate a token.


6. Obtain the YellowDog Agent and install/configure it on your on-premise systems using the Token above.

# Script Installation

Python version 3.7 or later is required. It's recommended that installation is performed in a Python virtual environment (or similar) to isolate the installation from other Python environments on your system.

Installation is via `pip` and PyPI using: 

```shell
pip install -U yellowdog-python-examples
```

The command line above is also used to update the commands.

# Usage

Commands are run from the command line. Invoking the command with the `--help` or `-h` option will display the command line options applicable to a given command, e.g.:

```text

# Configuration

By default, the operation of all commands is configured using a TOML configuration file.

The configuration file has three possible sections:

1. A `common` section that contains required security properties for interacting with the YellowDog platform, sets the Namespace in which YellowDog assets and objects are created, and a Tag that is used for tagging and naming assets and objects.
2. A `workRequirement` section that defines the properties of Work Requirements to be submitted to the YellowDog platform.
3. A `workerPool` section that defines the properties of Provisoned Worker Pools to be created using the YellowDog platform. 

There is a documented template TOML file provided in [config.toml.template](config.toml.template), containing the main properties that can be configured.

The configuration filename can be supplied in three different ways:

1. On the command line, using the `--config` or `-c` options, e.g.:<br>`yd-submit -c jobs/config_1.toml`
2. Using the `YD_CONF` environment variable, e.g.: <br>`export YD_CONF="jobs/config_1.toml"`
3. If neither of the above is supplied, the commands look for a `config.toml` file in the current directory

The options above are shown in order of precedence, i.e., a filename supplied on the command line supersedes one set in `YD_CONF`, which supersedes the default.

# Naming Restrictions

All entity names used within the YellowDog Platform must comply with the following restrictions:

- Names can only contain the following: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores (note that spaces are not permitted)
- Names must start with a letter
- Names must end with a letter or digit
- Name length must be <= 60 characters

These restrictions apply to entities including Namespaces, Tags, Work Requirements, Task Groups, Tasks, Worker Pools, and Compute Requirements, and also apply to entities that are currently used indirectly by these scripts: Usernames, Credentials, Keyrings, Compute Sources and Compute Templates).

# Common Properties

The `[common]` section of the configuration file can contain the following properties:

| Property    | Description                                                                         |
|:------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`       | The **key** of the YellowDog Application under which the commands will run          |
| `secret`    | The **secret** of the YellowDog Application under which the commands will run       |
| `namespace` | The **namespace** to be used to manage resources                                    |
| `tag`       | The **tag** to be used for tagging resources and naming objects                     |
| `url`       | The **URL** of the YellowDog Platform API endpoint, if the default isn't to be used |
| `mVars`     | A dictionary containing **Mustache substitutions** (see the Mustache section below) |

An example `common` section is shown below:

```toml
[common]
    key = "asdfghjklzxcvb-1234567"
    secret = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm1234567890qwertyu"
    namespace = "project-x"
    tag = "testing-{{username}}"
```

The indentation is optional in TOML files and is for readability only.

## Specifying Common Properties using the Command Line or Environment Variables

All the common properties can be set using command line options, or in environment variables.

The **command line options** are as follows:

- `--key` or `-k`
- `--secret` or `-s`
- `--namespace` or `-n`
- `--tag` or `-t`
- `--url` or `-u`

These options can also be listed by running a command with the `--help` or `-h` option.

The **environment variables** are as follows:

- `YD_KEY`
- `YD_SECRET`
- `YD_NAMESPACE`
- `YD_TAG`
- `YD_URL`

When setting the value of the above properties, a property set on the command line takes precedence over one set via an environment variable, and both take precedence over a value set in a configuration file.

If all the required common properties are set using the command line or environment variables, then the entire `common` section of the TOML file can be omitted.

## Mustache Template Directives in Common Properties

Note the use of `{{username}}` in the value of the `tag` property: this is a **Mustache** template directive that can optionally be used to insert the login username of the user running the commands. So, for username `abc`, the `tag` would be set to `testing-abc`. This can be helpful to disambiguate multiple users running with the same configuration data.

Mustache substitutions are discussed below.

# Mustache Template Directives

Mustache template substitutions provide a powerful way of introducing variable values into TOML configuration files, Work Requirement JSON definitions, and Worker Pool JSON definitions. They can be included in the value of any property in each of these objects, including in values within lists (e.g., for the `arguments` property) and arrays (e.g., the `environment` property).

Mustache substitutions are expressed using `{{variable}}` notation, where the expression is replaced by the value of `variable`.

Substitutions can also be performed for non-string (number and boolean) values using the `num:` and `bool:` prefixes within the Mustache directive:

- Define the Mustache directive using one of the following patterns: `"{{num:my_int}}"`, `"{{num:my_float}}"`, `"{{bool:my_bool}}"`
- Variable definitions supplied on the command line would then be of the form: `-m my_int=5 -m my_float=2.5 -m my_bool=true`
- In the processed JSON or TOML, these values would become `5`, `2.5` and `true`, respectively, converted from strings to their correct JSON types

## Default Mustache Directives

The following substitutions are automatically provided:

| Directive      | Description                                                    | Example of Substitution |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------|
| `{{username}}` | The current user's login username, lower case, spaces replaced | jane_smith              |
| `{{date}}`     | The current date (UTC): YYYYMMDD                               | 20221027                |
| `{{time}}`     | The current time (UTC): HHMMSS                                 | 163026                  |
| `{{datetime}}` | Concatenation of the date and time above, with a '-' separator | 20221027-163026         |
| `{{random}}`   | A random, three digit hexadecimal number (lower case)          | a1c                     |

For the `date`, `time`, `datetime` and `random` directives, the same values will be used for the duration of a command -- i.e., if `{{time}}` is used within multiple properties, the same value will be used for each substitution.

## User-Defined Mustache Directives

Arbitrary Mustache directives can be supplied using command line options, by setting environment variables prefixed with `YD_SUB_`, or by including the directives in the `[common]` section of the TOML configuration file.

1. The **command line** option is `--mustache-substitution` (or `-m`). For example, `yd-submit -m project_code=pr-213-a -m run_id=1234` will establish two new Mustache directives `{{project_code}}` and `{{run_id}}`, which will be substituted by `pr-213-a` and `1234` respectively.


2. For **environment variables**, setting the variable `YD_SUB_project_code="pr-213-a"` will create a new Mustache directive `{{project_code}}`, which will be substituted by `pr-213-a`.


3. For **setting within the TOML file**, include an **`mVars`** dictionary in the `[common]` section of the file. E.g., `mVars = {project_code = "pr-213a", run_id = "1234"}`.

Directives set on the command line take precedence over directives set in environment variables, and both of them take precedence over directives set in a TOML file.

This method can be used to override the default directives, e.g., setting `-m username="other-user"` will override the default `{{username}}` directive.

# Work Requirement Properties

The `workRequirement` section of the configuration file is optional. It's used only by the `yd-submit` command, and controls the Work Requirement that is submitted to the Platform.

The details of a Work Requirement to be submitted can be captured entirely within the TOML configuration file for simple examples. More complex examples capture the Work Requirement in a combination of the TOML file plus a JSON document, or in a JSON document only.

## Work Requirement JSON File Structure

Work Requirements are represented in JSON documents using a containment hierarchy of a **Work Requirement** containing a **list of Task Groups**, containing a **list of Tasks**.

A very simple example document is shown below with a top-level Work Requirement containing two Task Groups each containing two Tasks, each with a different set of arguments to be passed to the Task.

```json
{
  "taskGroups": [
    {
      "tasks": [
        {
          "arguments": [1, 2, 3]
        },
        {
          "arguments": [4, 5, 6]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "tasks": [
        {
          "arguments": [7, 8, 9]
        },
        {
          "arguments": [10, 11, 12]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

To specify the file containing the JSON document, either populate the `workRequirementData` property in the `workRequirement` section of the TOML configuration file with the JSON filename, or specify it on the command line using the `--work-requirement` or `-r` options (which will override any value set in the TOML file), e.g.

`yd-submit --config myconfig.toml --work-requirement my_workreq.json`

## Property Inheritance

To simplify and optimise the definition of Work Requirements, there is a property inheritance mechanism. Properties that are set at a higher level in the hierarchy are inherited at lower levels, unless explicitly overridden.

This means that a property set in the `workRequirement` section of the TOML file can be inherited successively by the Work Requirement, Task Groups and Tasks in the JSON document (assuming the property is valid at each level).  Hence, Tasks inherit from Task Groups, which inherit from the Work Requirement in the JSON document, which inherits from the `workRequirement` properties in the TOML file.

Overridden properties are also inherited. E.g., if a property is set at the Task Group level, it will be inherited by the Tasks in that Task Group unless explicitly overridden.

## Work Requirement Property Dictionary

The following table outlines all the properties available for defining Work Requirements, and the levels at which they are allowed to be used. So, for example, the `provider` property can be set in the TOML file, at the Work Requirement Level or at the Task Group Level, but not at the Task level, and property `dependentOn` can only be set at the Task Group level.

All properties are optional except for **`taskType`** (or **`TaskTypes`**).

| Property Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                              | TOML | WR  | Task Grp. | Task |

## Automatic Properties

In addition to the inheritance mechanism, some properties are set automatically by the `yd-submit` command, as a usage convenience if they're not explicitly provided.

### Work Requirement, Task Group and Task Naming

- The **Work Requirement** name is automatically set using a concatenation of the `tag` property, a UTC timestamp, and three random hex characters: e,g,. `mytag_221024-155524-40a`.
- **Task Group** names are automatically created for any Task Group that is not explicitly named, using names of the form `task_group_1` (or `task_group_01`, etc., for larger numbers of Task Groups).
- **Task** names are automatically created for any Task that is not explicitly named, using names of the form `task_1` (or `task_01`, etc., for larger numbers of Tasks). The Task counter resets for each different Task Group.

### Task Types

- If `taskType` is set only at the TOML file level, then `taskTypes` is automatically populated for Task Groups, unless overridden.
- If `taskType` is set at the Task level, then `taskTypes` is automatically populated for Task Groups level using the accumulated Task Types from the Tasks, unless overridden.
- If `taskTypes` is set at the Task Group Level, and has only one Task Type entry, then `taskType` is automatically set at the Task Level using the single Task Type, unless overridden.

## Mustache Directives in Work Requirement Properties

Mustache template directives can be used within any property value in TOML configuration files or Work Requirement JSON files. See the description [above](#mustache-template-directives) for more details on Mustache directives. This is a powerful feature that allows Work Requirements to be parameterised by supplying values on the command line, via environment variables or via the TOML file.

## File Storage Locations and File Usage

This section discusses how to upload files from local storage to the YellowDog Object Store, how those files are transferred to Worker Nodes for Task processing, how the results of Task processing are returned by Worker Nodes, and how files are transferred back from the YellowDog Object Store to local storage.

### Files Uploaded to the Object Store from Local Storage

When a Work Requirement is submitted using `yd-submit`, files are uploaded to the YellowDog Object Store if they're included in the list of files in the `inputs` property. (For the case of the `bash` Task Type, the script specified in the `executable` property is also automatically uploaded as a convenience, even if not included in the `inputs` list.)

Files are uploaded to the Namespace specified in the configuration. Within the Namespace, each Work Requirement has a separate folder that shares the name of the Work Requirement, and in which all files related to the Work Requirement are stored.

1. Files to be uploaded that are in the **same directory as the Work Requirement specification** (the TOML or JSON file) are uploaded to the root of the Work Requirement folder.


2. Files to be uploaded that are in **subdirectories below the Work Requirement specification, or where absolute pathnames are supplied** are placed in the Object Store in directories that mirror their local storage locations.


3. Files to be uploaded that are in **directories relative to the Work Requirement specification, using `..` relative paths** are placed in Object Store directories in which the `..` parts of the pathname are replaced with an integer count of the number of `..` entries (because we can't use the `..` relative form in the Object Store).

Assuming a Namespace called `development` and a Work Requirement named `testrun_221108-120404-7d2`, the following locations are used when uploading files following the patterns above:

```shell
"inputs" : ["file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/dev/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["/home/dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/home/dev/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["../dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/1/dev/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["../../dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/2/dev/file_1.txt
```

**Using `flattenUploadPaths`**

The `flattenUploadPaths` property can be used to suppress the mirroring of any local directory structure when uploading files to the Object Store. If set to `true`, all files will be uploaded to the root of the Work Requirement folder. For example:

```shell
"inputs" : ["file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["/home/dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["../dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/file_1.txt
"inputs" : ["../../dev/file_1.txt"] -> development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/file_1.txt
```

The property default is `false`. This property **can only be set at the Work Requirement level** and will therefore apply to all Task Groups and Tasks within a Work Requirement.

### Files Downloaded to a Node for use in Task Execution

When a Task is executed by a Worker on a Node, its required files are downloaded from the Object Store prior to Task execution. Any file listed in the `inputs` for a Task is assumed to be required, along with any additional files specified in the `verifyAtStart` and `verifyWait` lists. (Note that a file should only appear in one of these three lists, otherwise `yd-submit` will return an error.)

When a Task is started by the Agent, its working directory has a pattern something like:

`/var/opt/yellowdog/yd-agent-4/data/workers/1/ydid_task_D0D0D0_68f5e5be-dc93-49eb-a824-1fcdb52f9195_1_1`

(`ydid_task_D0D0D0_68f5e5be-dc93-49eb-a824-1fcdb52f9195_1_1` is an ephemeral directory that is removed after the Task finishes and any outputs have been uploaded.)

Files that are downloaded by the Agent prior to Task execution are located as follows:

1. If the `flattenInputPaths` property is set to `false` for the Task (this is the default), the downloaded objects are placed in subdirectories that mirror those in the Object Store, including the Work Requirement name, situated beneath the working directory.


2. If the `flattenInputPaths` property is set to `true` for the Task, the downloaded objects are all placed directly in root of the Task's working directory.

For example:

```shell
If the required object is: development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/dev/file_1.txt

then, if flattenInputPaths is false, the file will be found at:
 -> <working_directory>/testrun_221108-120404-7d2/dev/file_1.txt
 
else, if flattenInputPaths is true, the file will be found at:
 -> <working_directory>/file_1.txt 
 
where <working_directory> is:
  /var/opt/yellowdog/yd-agent-4/data/workers/1/ydid_task_D0D0D0_68f5e5be-dc93-49eb-a824-1fcdb52f9195_1_1/
```

### Files Uploaded from a Node to the Object Store after Task Execution

After Task completion, the Agent will upload specified output files to the Object Store. The files to be uploaded are those listed in the `outputs` property for the Task.

In addition, the console output of the Task is captured in a file called `taskoutput.txt` in the root of the Task's working directory. Whether the `taskoutput.txt` file is uploaded to the Object Store is determined by the `captureTaskOutput` property for the Task, and this is set to 'true' by default.

If Task outputs are created in subdirectories below the Task's working directory, include the directories for files in the `outputs` property. E.g., if a Task creates files `results/openfoam.tar.gz` and `results/openfoam.log`, then specify these for upload in the `outputs` property as follows:

`"outputs": ["results/openfoam.tar.gz", "results/openfoam.log"]`

When output files are uploaded to the Object Store, they are placed in a Task Group and Task specific directory. So, if the Namespace is `development`, the Work Requirement is `testrun_221108-120404-7d2`, the Task Group is `task_group_1` and the Task is `task_1`, then the files above would be uploaded to the Object Store as follows:

```shell
development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/task_group_1/task_1/results/openfoam.tar.gz
development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/task_group_1/task_1/results/openfoam.log
development:testrun_221108-120404-7d2/task_group_1/task_1/taskoutput.txt
```

### Files Downloaded from the Object Store to Local Storage

The `yd-download` command will download all objects from the Object Store to a local directory, on a per Work Requirement basis (including any files that have been uploaded). A local directory is created with the same name as the Namespace and containing the Work Requirement directories.

Use the `--interactive` option with `yd-download` to select which Work Requirement(s) to download.

For the example above, `yd-download` would create a directory called `development` in the current working directory, containing something like:

```shell
development
└── testrun_221108-120404-7d2
    ├── bash_script.sh
    ├── file_1.txt
    └── task_group_1
        └── task_1
            ├── results
            │   ├── openfoam.log
            │   └── openfoam.tar.gz
            └── taskoutput.txt
```

Note that everything within the `namespace:work-requirement` directory in the Object Store is downloaded, including any files that were specified in `inputs` and uploaded as part of the Work Requirement submission. Multiple Task Groups, and multiple Tasks will all appear in the directory structure.

If the `development` directory already exists, `yd-download` will try `development.01`, etc., to avoid overwriting previous downloads.

# Worker Pool Properties

The `workerPool` section of the TOML file defines the properties of the Worker Pool to be created, and is used by the `yd-provision` command. The only mandatory property is `templateId`. All other properties have defaults (or are not required).

The following properties are available:

| Property               | Description                                                                                            | Default        |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------|
| `autoscalingIdleDelay` | The time in minutes for which a node can be idle before it can be shut down by auto-scaling.           | `10.0` minutes |
| `autoShutdown`         | Whether the Worker Pool is shut down after all nodes have been idle for the `autoShutdownDelay`.       | `true`         |
| `autoShutdownDelay`    | The delay in minutes for which all nodes can be idle before the Worker Pool is shut down.              | `10.0` minutes |
| `minNodes`             | The minimum number of nodes to which the Worker Pool can be scaled down.                               | `0`            |
| `maxNodes`             | The maximum number of nodes to which the Worker Pool can be scaled up.                                 | `1`            |
| `name`                 | The name of the Worker Pool.                                                                           | Automatic      |
| `nodeBootTimeLimit`    | The time in minutes allowed for a node to boot and register with the platform before it is terminated. | `10.0` minutes |
| `targetInstanceCount`  | The initial number of nodes to create for the Worker Pool.                                             | `1`            |
| `templateId`           | The YellowDog Compute Template ID to use for provisioning.                                             |                |
| `workersPerNode`       | The number of Workers to establish on each node in the Worker Pool.                                    | `1`            |
| `workerPoolData`       | The name of a file containing a JSON document defining a Worker Pool.                                  |                |
| `workerTag`            | The Worker Tag to publish for the all of the Workers.                                                  |                |

## Automatic Properties

The name of the Worker Pool, if not supplied, is automatically generated using a concatenation of `wp_`, the `tag` property, a UTC timestamp, and three random hex characters: e,g,. `wp_mytag_221024-155524-b0a`.

## TOML Properties in the `workerPool` Section

Here's an example of the `workerPool` section of a TOML configuration file, showing all the possible properties that can be set:

```toml
[workerPool]
    autoShutdown = true
    autoShutdownDelay = 10
    autoscalingIdleDelay = 3
    maxNodes = 1
    minNodes = 1
    name = "my-worker-pool"
    nodeBootTimeLimit = 5
    targetInstanceCount = 1
    templateId = "ydid:crt:000000:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    workerTag = "tag-{{username}}"
    workersPerNode = 1
#   workerPoolData = "worker_pool.json"
```

## Worker Pool Specification Using JSON Documents

**Experimental Feature**

It's also possible to capture a Worker Pool definition as a JSON document. The JSON filename can be supplied either using the command line with the `--worker-pool` or `-p` parameter with `yd-provision`, or by populating the `workerPoolData` property in the TOML configuration file with the JSON filename. Command line specification takes priority over TOML specification.

The JSON specification allows the creation of **Advanced Worker Pools**, with different node types and the ability to specify Node Actions.

When using a JSON document to specify the Worker Pool, the schema of the document is identical to that expected by the YellowDog API for Worker Provisioning.

Examples will be provided at a later date.

## Mustache Directives in Worker Pool Properties

Mustache template directives can be used within any property value in TOML configuration files or Worker Pool JSON files. See the description [above](#mustache-template-directives) for more details on Mustache directives. This is a powerful feature that allows Worker Pools to be parameterised by supplying values on the command line, via environment variables, or via the TOML file.

An important distinction **only** when using Mustache directives within Worker Pool JSON documents is that each directive **must be preceded by a `__` (double underscore)** to disambiguate it from Mustache directives that are to be passed directly to the API. For example, use: `__{{username}}` to apply a substitution for the `username` variable.

# Command List

Help is available for all commands by invoking a command with the `--help` or `-h` option. Some command line parameters are common to all commands, while others are command-specific.

All destructive commands require user confirmation before taking effect. This can be suppressed using the `--yes` or `-y` option, in which case the command will proceed without confirmation.

Some commands support the `--interactive` or `-i` option, allowing user selections to be made. E.g., this can be used to select which object paths to delete.

The `--quiet` or `-q` option reduces the command output down to essential messages only. So, for example, `yd-delete -yq` would delete all matching object paths silently.

If you encounter an error it can be useful for support purposes to see the full Python stack trace. This can be enabled by running the command using the `--debug` option.

## yd-submit

The `yd-submit` command submits a new Work Requirement, according to the Work Requirement definition found in the `workRequirement` section of the TOML configuration file and/or the specification found in a Work Requirement JSON document supplied using the `--work-requirement` option.

Once submitted, the Work Requirement will appear in the **Work** tab in the YellowDog Portal.

The Work Requirement's progress can be tracked to completion by using the `--follow` (or `-f`) option when invoking `yd-submit`: the command will report on Tasks as they conclude and won't return until the Work Requirement has finished.

## yd-provision

The `yd-provision` command provisions a new Worker Pool according to the specifications in the `workerPool` section of the TOML configuration file and/or in the specification found in a Worker Pool JSON document supplied using the `--worker-pool` option.

Once provisioned, the Worker Pool will appear in the **Workers** tab in the YellowDog Portal, and its associated Compute Requirement will appear in the **Compute** tab.

## yd-cancel

The `yd-cancel` command cancels any active Work Requirements, including any pending Task Groups and the Tasks they contain. 

The `namespace` and `tag` values in the `config.toml` file are used to identify which Work Requirements to cancel.

By default, any Tasks that are currently running on Workers will continue to run to completion or until they fail. Tasks can be instructed to abort immediately by supplying the `--abort` or `-a` option to `yd-cancel`.

## yd-abort

The `yd-abort` command is used to abort Tasks that are currently running. The user interactively selects the Work Requirements to target, and then which Tasks within those Work Requirements to abort. The Work Requirements are not cancelled as part of this process.

The `namespace` and `tag` values in the `config.toml` file are used to identify which Work Requirements to list for selection.

## yd-download

The `yd-download` command downloads any objects created in the YellowDog Object Store.

The `namespace` and `tag` values are used to determine which objects to download. Objects will be downloaded to a directory with the same name as `namespace`. If a directory already exists, a new directory with name `<namespace>.01` (etc.) will be created.

## yd-delete

The `yd-delete` command deletes any objects created in the YellowDog Object Store.

The `namespace` and `tag` values in the `config.toml` file are used to identify which objects to delete.

## yd-upload

The `yd-upload` command uploads files from the local filesystem to the YellowDog Object store. Files are placed in the configured `namespace` within a directory supplied using the (required) `--directory` option, e.g.:

```shell
yd-upload --directory my_work_requirement file_1 file_2 morefiles/file3
```
To suppress the mirroring of the local directory structure within the object store, use the `--flatten-upload-paths` or `-f` option. Note that if this creates mutliple uploaded files with the same path in the Object Store folder, files will be overwritten.

Files in directories may be recursively uploaded using the `--recursive` or `-r` option, e.g.:

```shell
yd-upload --directory my_work_requirement -r mydir myotherdir
```

## yd-shutdown

The `yd-shutdown` command shuts down Worker Pools that match the `namespace` and `tag` found in the configuration file. All remaining work will be cancelled, but currently executing Tasks will be allowed to complete, after which the Compute Requirement will be terminated.

## yd-instantiate

The `yd-instantiate` command instantiates a Compute Requirement (i.e., a set of instances that are managed by their creator and do not automatically become part of a YellowDog Worker Pool). This command uses the data from the `workerPool` configuration, but only uses the `templateId` and `targetInstanceCount` properties.

## yd-terminate

The `yd-terminate` command immediately terminates Compute Requirements that match the `namespace` and `tag` found in the configuration file. Any executing Tasks will be terminated immediately, and the Worker Pool will be shut down.
